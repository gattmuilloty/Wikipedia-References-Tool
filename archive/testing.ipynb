When looking into its history it quickly becomes apparent that it has been both.Headwear for women began in earnest during the Middle Ages when the church decreed that their hair must be covered.  During the 18th century, milliners took the hat-making art out of the home and established the millinery profession. Today, a ‘milliner’ defines a person associated with the profession of hat making. In the 18th century however, a milliner was more of a stylist. Traditionally a woman’s occupation, the milliner not only created hats or bonnets to go with costumes but also chose the laces, trims and accessories to complete an ensemble. The term ‘milliner’ comes from the Italian city of Milan, where in the 1700’s, the finest straws were braided and the best quality hat forms were made. DOUBLE OR NOTHING18th century Pancake style ‘shepherdess’ hats were popular throughout most of the 18th century, in varying brim widths. These hats were considered necessary to keep the sun away from fair complexions, especially as the parasol was not a fashionable accessory during this period.In the 1770’s (when huge wigs and hairstyles were fashionable) the ‘calash’ bonnet was worn to protect the high hairstyles from the weather. Collapsible bonnets, they were made of strips of wood or whalebone sewn into channels of a silk hood. A front ribbon allowed the wearer to hold the calash securely over her face while walking in the wind.A taste for simpler fabrics in the 1780’s, anticipated the more democratic styles that followed the French Revolution. Cotton was introduced as a fashion fabric. Simple cotton house bonnets ornamented with a separate ribbon became fashionable for all echelons of society. The elite still wore hats (sometimes atop the bonnet) with tall crowns adorned with wide silk ribbon bows. Hats fell from favour after the French Revolution. They were associated with the upper classes and it was considered stylish to be democratic. Turbans were introduced into English fashions in the 1790’s and remained fashionable until the 1820’s. Style inspiration came from England’s increased trade with India for cotton. This was necessitated by inaccessibility to other cotton markets, namely Napoleon’s Egypt and the United States, with which relations were still poor.BONNET DU JOUR19th Century – 1800 – 1860  In the 1810’s straw bonnets were de rigueur. Alternatively, inexpensive ‘bonnet board’ was used. It was made of cardboard, then pressed in a roller machine to create a design. Bonnet board was also a response to lack of trade goods from Napoleon’s Italy, the traditional source for quality straw bonnets. Experiments with silk covered buckram proved successful for creating bonnets. It was used briefly in hats of the 1820’s that were decorated with towers of panaches (feather plumes) and silk bows. By 1830 bonnets grew to huge proportions. A large brim framed the wearer’s face from the front but hid her profile from the side. A veil protected her identity and propriety as well as her delicate skin from the sun’s rays.Brim size decreased dramatically in the 1840’s but still covered most of the wearer’s hair and much of her face. From the mid 1850’s the bonnet’s depth reduced to expose more of the face and hair. The ‘Bavolette’ was a ribbon frill at the back of the bonnet. Its purpose was covering the neck, which was considered an erogenous zone in the mid 19th century. Necks were only on view with evening dress! Once again, a brief foray into hats over bonnets occurred in the late 1850’s when the ‘wide-awake’ was introduced. It was a revival of the 18th century shepherdess hat that sported a broad brim and shallow crown.THREE WOMEN IN A BOATER19th Century – 1860 – 1900 By 1860 parasols had become a fashion staple and bonnets, except for cold weather wear, became purely ornamental. Due to their reduced functionality, bonnets decreased in size throughout the decade. Styles began with the ‘Spoon’ bonnet named for its shallow shape. It had a peaked crown that could be decorated with a nosegay of flowers. The even smaller ‘Fanchon’ was popular in 1865. It was little more than a triangular shaped piece of straw or silk, often with wide ribbons that framed the wearer’s chin.Throughout the 1860’s hats began to be re-introduced into the wardrobe. They included Glengarry highland caps and little circular pork pie hats. Tyrolean style peaked crown hats and little doll hats appeared at the end of the decade. The doll hats were decorated with cockades of feathers. They were worn perched at the front of the head over enormous hairstyles.   Throughout the 1870’s and 1880’s, hats and bonnets were on a fashion par. Women who wanted a more modest appearance often preferred bonnets. Sadly for bonnets, this eventually associated them with a matronly appearance. Very tall hats of the mid 1880’s were known as ‘3-story’ or ‘flowerpots’ and for very good reason. They soared atop the hair, appearing as if a roof on the tower of a building. This style originated as a revival of a late 18th century woman’s riding hat. That in turn was a copy of a man’s style of the same period.Masculine styled clothes and hats entered women’s wardrobes in the 1890’s via new forms of sporting and activity clothes. ‘Boaters’ and ‘Trilbys’, previously considered masculine, were now appropriate wear for all but the dressiest of occasions. Hats downsized in the middle of the 1890’s but grew in width again by 1900OUCH!20th Century – 1900 – 1920  In the early Edwardian period (1901-1907) it was fashionable for a lady’s silhouette to resemble an S-shape. The hat was an essential element. It was worn on top of piled up hair and positioned to cantilever over the face. This curvaceous form was carried through the bodice that was pouched over the waist and ended in a trained skirt. Also popular in this era was the ‘toque’, the name given to a brimless hat.After 1908 the silhouette became more slender. Conversely the hat became increasingly larger. By 1911 hats were at their largest, often with the brim extending beyond the breadth of the wearer’s shoulders. To secure these huge creations to the head, hat pins – sometimes as long as 18 inches – were skewered through the hair and hat. The hatpin had other advantages too. Any man who attempted an unwanted advance soon discovered that a hatpin was all a frail woman needed to defend herself.During the First World War hairstyles decreased in size so hats gradually began to sit lower on the head and, generally speaking, became quite plain. Large plumes and ornate decorations were frowned on. It was considered unpatriotic because it suggested that the wearer was more concerned with her own appearance than with the war effort.By the end of the war and in honour of the soldier’s girlfriend (the era’s heroine) the fashionable ideal was for a youthful look. Hats slipped down the head, making the wearer appear as if she were dressing-up in her mother’s hat. Conveniently, the deeper crown also provided more security in keeping the hat in place while traveling in an open car.BY GOSH – THE CLOCHE20th Century – 1920 – 1940 The crown continued to deepen in the 1920’s, eventually covering the entire head in the ‘cloche’ style. Brims were optional but usually utilised only on summer hats, where the brim acted as a visor from the sun’s rays.By the early 1930’s crowns became shallow once again to accommodate the decade’s fuller curled hairstyles. Wide brimmed hats were popular. On hot summer day’s they acted like parasols, which were now out of fashion. Mannish styled ‘fedoras’ were perfectly suited to wear with tailored suits. By the end of the decade, crowns began to grow upward much like the 3-story hats of the 1880’sHALO HALO20th Century – 1940 – 1965  The wartime 40’s saw a huge variety of hats that were suitable for any face shape, hairstyle or personal preference. Throughout the war and on both sides of the Atlantic, elaborate creations brightened dreary utility fashions, brought about by rationing. In fact the only items not rationed were hat materials. Explosions of feathers, veiling and artificial flowers were popular. They were dubbed in France as ‘piece de resistance’ or ‘resistance piece’ against Nazi occupation. The ‘Doll’ hat, a very small hat that perched on the very front of the forehead, revived Victorian styles. There was also a brief resurgence of the bonnet, as well as turbans and halo hats. The latter sat on the back of the head and framed the face and the fashionable upswept pompadour hairstyles.  Post war 1940’s and 1950’s saw many women choosing not to wear hats on a regular basis. To preserve its market, the millinery industry set about creating variety and extravagance. Generally speaking hats remained small and close to the head. They were now touted as the essential accessory to complete the ensemble. Alternatively, ‘pancake’ or ‘cart wheel’ hats sat flat atop the head reviving turn of the century styles. By the late 1950’s the turban returned to fashion. As hairstyles grew in size in the early 1960’s, hat styles had to adapt. In vogue were tiny poufs of veil or pillboxes that perched on the back of the head.  UNTIL THE HAT LADY SINGS20th Century – 1965 – 2000 As fashions of the mid 1960’s were geared for youth, which wore hats sparingly, headwear became an accessory of the past. Even the Catholic Church dropped its dress code, abandoning required head coverings for women in 1967. With the exception of cold weather wear, the fashion hat all but disappeared in the 1970’s. Credit goes to Princess Diana’s influence in the 1980’s that met with some success in bringing hats back into style. More recent attempts to bring back the hat have centered on health in response to holes in the ozone layer. This has given reasons to think about hats once again. In reality, its role as the necessary accessory is long gone. Until the next time! Written by Jonathan Walford/Kickshaw Productions.

Among the men seems to be an even mix of summer straws and winter fur felts. By the way, Whirlaway was that year's winner. Whirlaway also went on to win the Triple Crown.With regard to hats, the Kentucky Derby might best be known as a day for ladies to show off their fanciest headdresses. However, it is also a great day for men to try on their special summer straw hats to get into the full excitement of the event.It is all part of a tradition that now dates back to the first running of the derby in 1875!The first Saturday in May, the derby is the unofficial start of summer in The South. It is a festive time, and anybody who is anybody gets dressed to the nines to attend “the best two minutes in sports.”Along with the great hats, everybody joins in singing Stephen Foster’s “My Old Kentucky Home.” They also refresh themselves with fine Kentucky bourbon mixed in mint juleps, which are served in silver cups.The famed twin spires of Churchill Downs, where the race is run every year, were just about the tallest structures in Louisville, Ky, just before the turn of the last century. Now they are dwarfed by the stadium complex that has been built up around them.The race, itself, is the first jewel of the Triple Crown. It is followed by the Preakness and the cruelling Belmont Stakes—the longest of the three races.Whether you are attending the races this year in person or going to a satellite party, it isn’t too late to get your hat! In keeping with the tradtional straw look fellahs, might we recommend a boater, an optimo or a classy panama fedora?See you in the betting line, as we cash in our winners. With regard to hats, the Kentucky Derby might best be known as a day for ladies to show off their fanciest headdresses.

He designs for the world's   leading couture houses including Givenchy, Chanel, Valentino, Ralph Lauren   and Donna Karan. In 2007 he was awarded an OBE by Prince Charles for his service to the British   fashion industry. Today hundreds of millions of television viewers from all   over the world saw his designs on celebrities and royals in the bridal   party. The late Isabella Blow, style editor of Tatler helped Treacy (44) to launch   his career and often wore his latest designs. Meanwhile, soccer star David Beckham arrived at Westminster Abbey for today’s   royal wedding sporting his Order of the British Empire – on the wrong side. The normal custom is to wear medals on the left lapel and to wear the medals   of a deceased family member on the right. However, the player, accompanied   by his pregnant wife Victoria, wore his medal on the right lapel of his   Ralph Lauren suit. Victoria Beckham wore a midnight blue VB dress with a   Philip Treacy military pill box hat. Prince William became the Duke of Cambridge today just hours before his   marriage to Kate Middleton in a historic ceremony watched by million across   the globe. His new wife becomes her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge   when the happy couple are pronounced husband and wife by the Archbishop of   Canterbury. The Queen marked the royal wedding by giving her grandson the dukedom - the   highest rank in British peerage. The news came as hundreds of thousands of well-wishers poured into London   eager for a glimpse of the wedding. Early morning trains, usually all-but deserted on a Bank Holiday, were packed   with royal fans, some wearing mock tiaras, most clutching Union flags. They were rewarded with the news that the happy couple will brave the elements   and travel from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace in the open-topped   1902 State Landau. As the bride and groom awoke after spending the traditional night apart,   thousands of well-wishers were already lining the processional route from   Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. Forecasters' warnings of rain showers over central London failed to dampen the   mounting excitement. Paddy Harverson, the Prince of Wales's communications secretary, said William   was relaxed and having breakfast ahead of his wedding. The Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall, who is officiating at the ceremony   while the Archbishop of Canterbury marries the couple, predicted \"a   tremendously warm and uplifting day\". - Independent.ie reportersDownload our Free iPhone App Now  PrintEmailWorld News Video (video)            Venice under water: City's unprecedented floodingWater levels in Venice have reached unprecedented levels, leaving over half of the city under water.

It was a political speech about equal rights. It was said by someone who want non-paying schoolchildren to attend high class schools probably for free.                                    msendi - 2011-10-20 10:33\t                            What is wrong with this guy???                            vdwjasper - 2011-10-20 11:30\t                                    I'm in no way a Malema fan, but in what way is \"cooley\" derogatory?

This was the name the English had given to the indians. \"Coolies\" were not allowed to walk on pavements or travel in 1st class on the the train or own land, hence the name Coolie has quite a bitter taste to it. Such a pity we have names for each other and just cant seem to move on.                                    Jack - 2011-10-20 15:00\t                                    Actually, the word Coolie comes from Urdu and means \"day-labourer\". It was used by the Pommies to describe any unskilled labour from the Asian region (including China, Japan and India amongst others). It became the SA word for a person of Indian descent through usage - all the Indians at that time being \"coolies\". The various Nguni names for persons of Indian descent were derived from the word Coolie, which is now considered to be politically incorrect. The Nguni variations are thus, by association, politically incorrect.                                    nasheenar - 2011-10-20 15:22\t                                    VDWJasper - Wiki's take on the word Coolie.Coolie (variously spelled Cooli, Cooly, Kuli, Quli, Koelie etc.) is a historical term for manual labourers or slaves from Asia, particularly China, India, and the Phillipines during the 19th century and early 20th century. It is also a contemporary racial slur or ethnic nickname for people of Asian descent, including people from India, Central Asia, etc[1], particularly in South Africa[2                                    debbie.van.niekerk - 2012-05-09 13:08\t                                    I know the answer...

Firstly, I am Indian, raised in a so-called 'Indian' area, and in my entire high school years (mid-90s) I studied alongside black students. I now have children who are in pre-school and they are also learning alongside black and white students. So what am I missing out here?

The Indians and whites don't have a problem if they don't go to schools with black children so why do they have a problem if their people don't go to schools with children from other races? Does he really see blacks as that inferior and does he feel if blacks go to \"only black\" schools they're being discriminated against. Perhaps he knows something we don't about blacks. Interesting!!                                    Mandla - 2011-10-20 10:58\t                            it is unfortunate that most of us when we refer to Indians in our native language we usually call them Makula, however it is unfortunate and regretable that the ghost of colonialism is still haunting us. Cde Julius was not speaking in the spirit of racial segregation. i would say his utterances were informed by racial hatred if he had spoken in English. just that certain people like to be alarmists and they get this to be an opportunity to persue their pythonic agenda                            mastersvoice - 2011-10-20 11:12\t                                    Mandla - its a sad day when followers have to try and make up excuses for their leaders.

Harry - 2011-10-20 14:55\t                                    Okay, Lets say that he made another mistake. So, what is the comment about \"going to school with Indians\". What is he trying to say? Black kids have been going to schools in previously Indian areas since the early 90's. Does he have evidence that certain schools are prevent Black students from attending. If so, then he should take the department of education to Court. @Mandla, I suspect he is just trying to get people to go to his march and support him but causing tension in that area between Black Africans and Indian people. I guess you can lead by creating unity or by sowing division...                                    Red - 2011-11-16 00:29\t                                    So what you are saying is that only white people need to reform their language as times change, but black people don't need to? Wow, that's incredibly racist. As times have changed and people have learned from their mistakes we have changed the words we use accordingly. There are certain words we no longer use to describe gay people, black people, people with disabilities and people of Indian decent. Are you telling me that black people are not capable of changing their vocabulary too? That was a very weak excuse Mandla. None of us are perfect.. white, black, gay or straight. Black people will never be able to lift themselves up as a people group until they get over blaming colonialism for absolutely everything. Weak cowardly people do that. I think you and SA black people are better and stronger than that and I have hope and faith that they (and you) can take responsibility for their own actions. It starts by making our leaders responsible for the things they do and say. Be a grown up. Be responsible for yourself. And hold the feet of our leaders to the flame.                                    jade.neil - 2011-10-20 11:00\t                            Uhmmmmmm was he not supposed to be in hospital for \"flu-like\" symptoms????????.  he MOST certainly DOES NOT look sick.

Of course the blacks will say it is not derogatory because they are saying it about other people it is not other people calling them names                                    Peter - 2011-10-20 12:22\t                            So if Malema is racist nothing happens to him but if Darren Scott is he loses everything!!!! It is such a shame that such a P@$CK has the potential to destroy our beauitiful country and nobody in the ANC has the balls to da anything about it!!!!!!                            anthony.swart - 2011-10-20 12:23\t                            Wonder when Malema gets the chance to utter this rubbish cos it appears that his foot is permanently in his mouth!                            Sandy - 2011-10-20 12:24\t                            When is this madness going to stop??!!                            Castle - 2011-10-20 12:25\t                            what's wrong with this K...........                            ruben.maistry - 2011-10-20 12:26\t                            Malema is not as stupid as many make him out to be.I see this as a compliment to the Indian, as Juju boy knows exactly how much his people can learn from an Indian, that is if they want to learn. Ask Mr Nelson Mandela and others.                            Christopher - 2012-05-07 17:53\t                                    Yes u are right he is not as stupid as we think, he is in fact faaaaaaaaaaaar dumber than we thought.                                    pages: 123\n",

If you have a shady yard or want to perk up a shaded spot in your home, at your front door, on your porch, or around your patio, put together a pretty shade-loving container that&rsquo;s also easy to care for. Plants like caladiums and creeping Jenny will thrive in the shade, and they&rsquo;ll also add great color and movement to your planters. If you&rsquo;re looking for the best plants for the shade and great flowers that thrive in shade, also reach for impatiens, coleus, sweet potato vines, mazus, vincas, torenias, violas, petunias, pansies, hellebores (Lenten roses), hostas, astilbes, and trilliums. They look great and will thrive in full to partial shade. Shade-loving flowers aren&rsquo;t too hard to find. Ask around at your local garden store, and you&rsquo;ll be able to locate the ingredients and put together any one of these shade-tolerant container ideas. Also, in regards to your container, don&rsquo;t forget to think vertical.

Ladies’ church hats have a long and storied history. Church hats have been a key part of churchgoers’ Sunday best for years, and are still an important aspect of dress in some churches today. The practice of covering one’s head for church originally came from the Bible—1 Corinthians 11:15, to be precise. The simple head covering has been adapted and expanded to become a stylish part of Southern women’s churchgoing attire. At the turn of the century, many Southern ladies wore simple hats to church out of respect, reverence for the service, and continuity with passed-down traditions. The church hat tradition continues today, with hats—sometimes called crowns—in bright colors, bold patterns, and eye-catching styles at Sunday services across the South. Dressing up is an essential part of Southern style, and churchgoing Southern ladies are known for their stylish ensembles—especially the pretty hats that can be matched with a Sunday suit. Church hats even come with their own etiquette, which has been developed over centuries. Ladies’ church hats have rich millinery history and undeniable style. They’re a time-tested, beloved tradition that is still thriving. Church hats remain an essential part of many women’s Sunday best and church outfits across the South, so read on to see some of the pretty church hats that keep the tradition alive.Start Slideshow 1 of 11SaveFBTweetellipsisMorePinterestMailEmailiphoneSend Text MessagePrintFreesia Wide Brim Hat Freesia Wide Brim Hat   Credit: macys.comBuy it: $78, macys.comWe love the understated, two-tone color scheme of this church hat.1 of 11ApplicationsView AllAdvertisementAdvertisement2 of 11SaveFBTweetellipsisMorePinterestMailEmailiphoneSend Text MessagePrintFlattering Lines Church Hat Flattering Lines Church Hat   Credit: especiallyyours.comBuy it: $79.99, especiallyyours.comThis pillbox hat with a net veil is the epitome of elegance.2 of 11ApplicationsView All3 of 11SaveFBTweetellipsisMorePinterestMailEmailiphoneSend Text MessagePrintBlossom Hat Blossom Hat   Credit: macys.comBuy it: $78, macys.comThe prettiest polka dots for your Sunday best.3 of 11ApplicationsView AllAdvertisement4 of 11SaveFBTweetellipsisMorePinterestMailEmailiphoneSend Text MessagePrintTiered Lace ‘n’ Shine Church Hat Tiered Lace &lsquo;n&rsquo;

When looking into its history it quickly becomes apparent that it has been both.Headwear for women began in earnest during the Middle Ages when the church decreed that their hair must be covered.  During the 18th century, milliners took the hat-making art out of the home and established the millinery profession. Today, a ‘milliner’ defines a person associated with the profession of hat making. In the 18th century however, a milliner was more of a stylist. Traditionally a woman’s occupation, the milliner not only created hats or bonnets to go with costumes but also chose the laces, trims and accessories to complete an ensemble. The term ‘milliner’ comes from the Italian city of Milan, where in the 1700’s, the finest straws were braided and the best quality hat forms were made. DOUBLE OR NOTHING18th century Pancake style ‘shepherdess’ hats were popular throughout most of the 18th century, in varying brim widths. These hats were considered necessary to keep the sun away from fair complexions, especially as the parasol was not a fashionable accessory during this period.In the 1770’s (when huge wigs and hairstyles were fashionable) the ‘calash’ bonnet was worn to protect the high hairstyles from the weather. Collapsible bonnets, they were made of strips of wood or whalebone sewn into channels of a silk hood. A front ribbon allowed the wearer to hold the calash securely over her face while walking in the wind.A taste for simpler fabrics in the 1780’s, anticipated the more democratic styles that followed the French Revolution. Cotton was introduced as a fashion fabric. Simple cotton house bonnets ornamented with a separate ribbon became fashionable for all echelons of society. The elite still wore hats (sometimes atop the bonnet) with tall crowns adorned with wide silk ribbon bows. Hats fell from favour after the French Revolution. They were associated with the upper classes and it was considered stylish to be democratic. Turbans were introduced into English fashions in the 1790’s and remained fashionable until the 1820’s. Style inspiration came from England’s increased trade with India for cotton. This was necessitated by inaccessibility to other cotton markets, namely Napoleon’s Egypt and the United States, with which relations were still poor.BONNET DU JOUR19th Century – 1800 – 1860  In the 1810’s straw bonnets were de rigueur. Alternatively, inexpensive ‘bonnet board’ was used. It was made of cardboard, then pressed in a roller machine to create a design. Bonnet board was also a response to lack of trade goods from Napoleon’s Italy, the traditional source for quality straw bonnets. Experiments with silk covered buckram proved successful for creating bonnets. It was used briefly in hats of the 1820’s that were decorated with towers of panaches (feather plumes) and silk bows. By 1830 bonnets grew to huge proportions. A large brim framed the wearer’s face from the front but hid her profile from the side. A veil protected her identity and propriety as well as her delicate skin from the sun’s rays.Brim size decreased dramatically in the 1840’s but still covered most of the wearer’s hair and much of her face. From the mid 1850’s the bonnet’s depth reduced to expose more of the face and hair. The ‘Bavolette’ was a ribbon frill at the back of the bonnet. Its purpose was covering the neck, which was considered an erogenous zone in the mid 19th century. Necks were only on view with evening dress! Once again, a brief foray into hats over bonnets occurred in the late 1850’s when the ‘wide-awake’ was introduced. It was a revival of the 18th century shepherdess hat that sported a broad brim and shallow crown.THREE WOMEN IN A BOATER19th Century – 1860 – 1900 By 1860 parasols had become a fashion staple and bonnets, except for cold weather wear, became purely ornamental. Due to their reduced functionality, bonnets decreased in size throughout the decade. Styles began with the ‘Spoon’ bonnet named for its shallow shape. It had a peaked crown that could be decorated with a nosegay of flowers. The even smaller ‘Fanchon’ was popular in 1865. It was little more than a triangular shaped piece of straw or silk, often with wide ribbons that framed the wearer’s chin.Throughout the 1860’s hats began to be re-introduced into the wardrobe. They included Glengarry highland caps and little circular pork pie hats. Tyrolean style peaked crown hats and little doll hats appeared at the end of the decade. The doll hats were decorated with cockades of feathers. They were worn perched at the front of the head over enormous hairstyles.   Throughout the 1870’s and 1880’s, hats and bonnets were on a fashion par. Women who wanted a more modest appearance often preferred bonnets. Sadly for bonnets, this eventually associated them with a matronly appearance. Very tall hats of the mid 1880’s were known as ‘3-story’ or ‘flowerpots’ and for very good reason. They soared atop the hair, appearing as if a roof on the tower of a building. This style originated as a revival of a late 18th century woman’s riding hat. That in turn was a copy of a man’s style of the same period.Masculine styled clothes and hats entered women’s wardrobes in the 1890’s via new forms of sporting and activity clothes. ‘Boaters’ and ‘Trilbys’, previously considered masculine, were now appropriate wear for all but the dressiest of occasions. Hats downsized in the middle of the 1890’s but grew in width again by 1900OUCH!20th Century – 1900 – 1920  In the early Edwardian period (1901-1907) it was fashionable for a lady’s silhouette to resemble an S-shape. The hat was an essential element. It was worn on top of piled up hair and positioned to cantilever over the face. This curvaceous form was carried through the bodice that was pouched over the waist and ended in a trained skirt. Also popular in this era was the ‘toque’, the name given to a brimless hat.After 1908 the silhouette became more slender. Conversely the hat became increasingly larger. By 1911 hats were at their largest, often with the brim extending beyond the breadth of the wearer’s shoulders. To secure these huge creations to the head, hat pins – sometimes as long as 18 inches – were skewered through the hair and hat. The hatpin had other advantages too. Any man who attempted an unwanted advance soon discovered that a hatpin was all a frail woman needed to defend herself.During the First World War hairstyles decreased in size so hats gradually began to sit lower on the head and, generally speaking, became quite plain. Large plumes and ornate decorations were frowned on. It was considered unpatriotic because it suggested that the wearer was more concerned with her own appearance than with the war effort.By the end of the war and in honour of the soldier’s girlfriend (the era’s heroine) the fashionable ideal was for a youthful look. Hats slipped down the head, making the wearer appear as if she were dressing-up in her mother’s hat. Conveniently, the deeper crown also provided more security in keeping the hat in place while traveling in an open car.BY GOSH – THE CLOCHE20th Century – 1920 – 1940 The crown continued to deepen in the 1920’s, eventually covering the entire head in the ‘cloche’ style. Brims were optional but usually utilised only on summer hats, where the brim acted as a visor from the sun’s rays.By the early 1930’s crowns became shallow once again to accommodate the decade’s fuller curled hairstyles. Wide brimmed hats were popular. On hot summer day’s they acted like parasols, which were now out of fashion. Mannish styled ‘fedoras’ were perfectly suited to wear with tailored suits. By the end of the decade, crowns began to grow upward much like the 3-story hats of the 1880’sHALO HALO20th Century – 1940 – 1965  The wartime 40’s saw a huge variety of hats that were suitable for any face shape, hairstyle or personal preference. Throughout the war and on both sides of the Atlantic, elaborate creations brightened dreary utility fashions, brought about by rationing. In fact the only items not rationed were hat materials. Explosions of feathers, veiling and artificial flowers were popular. They were dubbed in France as ‘piece de resistance’ or ‘resistance piece’ against Nazi occupation. The ‘Doll’ hat, a very small hat that perched on the very front of the forehead, revived Victorian styles. There was also a brief resurgence of the bonnet, as well as turbans and halo hats. The latter sat on the back of the head and framed the face and the fashionable upswept pompadour hairstyles.  Post war 1940’s and 1950’s saw many women choosing not to wear hats on a regular basis. To preserve its market, the millinery industry set about creating variety and extravagance. Generally speaking hats remained small and close to the head. They were now touted as the essential accessory to complete the ensemble. Alternatively, ‘pancake’ or ‘cart wheel’ hats sat flat atop the head reviving turn of the century styles. By the late 1950’s the turban returned to fashion. As hairstyles grew in size in the early 1960’s, hat styles had to adapt. In vogue were tiny poufs of veil or pillboxes that perched on the back of the head.  UNTIL THE HAT LADY SINGS20th Century – 1965 – 2000 As fashions of the mid 1960’s were geared for youth, which wore hats sparingly, headwear became an accessory of the past. Even the Catholic Church dropped its dress code, abandoning required head coverings for women in 1967. With the exception of cold weather wear, the fashion hat all but disappeared in the 1970’s. Credit goes to Princess Diana’s influence in the 1980’s that met with some success in bringing hats back into style. More recent attempts to bring back the hat have centered on health in response to holes in the ozone layer. This has given reasons to think about hats once again. In reality, its role as the necessary accessory is long gone. Until the next time! Written by Jonathan Walford/Kickshaw Productions.

He worked under his mentor, James H. Knapp at Crofut & Knapp. Cavanagh became Vice President by 1907 and then President by 1923. The company Cavanagh-Dobbs Inc. was born in 1928. It included his own label, Cavanagh Hats, which was based out of New York City. Cavanagh opened an exclusive store, John Cavanagh, Ltd., at 247 Park Avenue in NYC. The company was one of the premiere hat-makers in the 1920s and 30s, and Cavanagh remained a premier hat maker through the 1950s, and made excellent hats into the 60s. Cavanagh introduced the Cavanagh Edge patented 25 February 1913. A second patent, for an improved version of the Cavanagh Edge was granted on May 19, 1931. John Cavanagh became an instrumental part of the Hat industry and helped to reshape and influence the design of men’s dress hats. His innovative ideas and approach to hat making earned him the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award. It was in recognition of his services to the American hat industry. Today’s Cavanagh Hats are as stylish and well made as the original hats John Cavanagh created back in the 1920’s and 1930’s. His legacy of expert craftsmanship continues today.John Cavanagh, InnovatorJohn Cavanagh, born January 16, 1864, started working in the hatting industry at 17 years of age. After a couple of false starts, he found himself at Crofut & Knapp (C&K), where he worked his way up to brim curler, an exacting and demanding job. His attention to detail caught the eye of James H. Knapp, creator of the American Derby, and one of the founders of Crofut & Knapp. Knapp mentored Cavanagh, and made him superintendent of the curling room. By 1893, C&K dissolved as a partnership and incorporated. Cavanagh was one of the five original stockholders. That same year, Knapp appointed Cavanagh as superintendent over the whole factory. By 1907, Cavanagh was general manager and vice-president of C&K. He ascended to the presidency in 1923, a position he held until 1937.Cavanagh helped form a new holding company in 1928 to consolidate C&K and Dobbs. The new company, Cavanagh-Dobbs, Inc., also included Cavanagh Hats, and John Cavanagh, Ltd., an exclusive retail outlet in New York City for the new line. In 1932, Hat Corporation of America was formed to merge Cavanagh-Dobbs, Inc., and their hat brands with Knox and Dunlap. Cavanagh retained the presidency of the new corporation until 1937, when he stepped down to become chairman of the board. He held this position until 1947. Essentially retired at that point, John Cavanagh was still elected as honorary chairman of the board until the end of his life in 1957.The Cavanagh EdgeAt the time John Cavanagh first started working on the Cavanagh Edge process, there were three basic types of brim edge treatments applied to hats.The first was the raw edge, where the brim was trimmed to size, with no extra appointments added. The second was the bound edge. On hard felt hats, such as the Derby, the edge of the brim needed to be bound in ribbon to keep the white residue of the shellac from showing through. Third was the welted edge. Welted edges were used to add strength to the edge of the brim of soft felt hats, which had been soaring in sales since Cavanagh recommended their reintroduction in 1906.The stitching on welts was a weak point, and not as attractive as Cavanagh would have liked. The intimate knowledge of brim edges that he gained from his job, as well as the knowledge of felt passed along by Knapp, enabled Cavanagh to perceive a solution to the deficiencies of bound and welted edges, a solution that would come to be known industry-wide as the Cavanagh Edge.Cavanagh Edges could be found on hats from Crofut & Knapp, Dobbs, Cavanagh, Knox, Dobbs, Stetson, Mallory, Resistol, Stack, Borsalino, Disney, Portis, Lee, Bond, Duff, and Stevens, just to name a few.Crofut & Knapp held the patent rights in 1913, but extended their exclusivity to Dobbs, a successful line of hats created by John Cavanagh in 1908. The creation of the Cavanagh line of hats in 1928 gave three brands the Edge.Crofut & Knapp does not appear to have licensed the process to any other manufacturers. With the expiration of the first patent by 1931, other manufacturers were finally free to offer their own version of the Cavanagh Edge, and the heyday of the felted welt edge really began. At its most basic, the Cavanagh Edge is a felted welt edge, and this is the term first marketed by Crofut & Knapp. It wasn’t until the 1920s that edge came to be known as the Cavanagh Edge. Over the years, many different names have been applied to it by the various manufacturers. Dobbs, for example, has given it the names Felted Welt Edge, Cavanagh Edge, Improved Cavanagh Edge (the second patent process, also marketed as the Cavart Patented Process), Guild Edge, and Dobbs Edge. Dobbs also offered a hand-finished Cronap Edge, in the 1930s in addition to the Cavanagh Edge, but the author is uncertain at this time as to what edge it represented. The name Guild Edge was first marketed in 1944, and is the name best associated with Dobbs. In Cavanagh Hats, it has always been the Cavanagh Edge.When Knox introduced their version in 1931, they named it the Custom Edge, a name they continued to use throughout the rest of their production. Stetson used the name Selv-Edge in 1933, but by 1940 changed it the Mode Edge. Borsalino referred to their edge informally as the Bordo Doppio, or “double edge.” Stevens called it the Hand-Felted Edge. Lee, perhaps one of the last manufacturers to adopt the style, called theirs the Edgelee.Few hatters today know how to work with Cavanagh Edged bodies, and fewer still is the number of felters that remember how to craft one. It is arcane knowledge from a bygone era. While hat making has not died off completely, certain techniques, such as the Cavanagh Edge, are virtually extinct. Felters and manufacturers have been pursued, cajoled, and even offered large sums of money to revive this lost art, but the answer keeps coming back a resounding, “No.” The option is always there, though. The concept is fairly simple, but the execution requires much skill and effort. For now, the Cavanagh Edge may be dead, but the process created by the master, John Cavanagh, will forever live on in the vintage hats that bear his edge of distinction.Read More about John Cavanagh >>Hat FinderDiscover The Perfect Hat With Our Hat Finder Tool.By selecting multiple options you can find the ideal hat for your style and preferences:[prdctfltr_sc_products preset=\"Homepage\" show_products=\"no\"]Main MenuHat StoreCapsCowboy HatsCustom HatsDress HatsOutdoor HatsStraw HatsBucket HatsCloth HatsCollectible HatsFedora HatsMovie HatsPanama HatsTop Rated Products Charlie Chaplin Hat Custom Handmade Bowler Derby$300.00 – $650.00 Stetson Navy Herringbone Ivy Cap - 100% Cotton Size Large$29.00 The Boss Handmade Western Cowboy Hat$399.00 – $799.00Hat StoreCowboy HatsDress HatsStraw HatsCustom HatsMovie HatsCollectible HatsFedora HatsOutdoor HatsIvy CapsHat CareHat ColorsHat SizesHat StylesHat TypesAbout HatsHistory of HatsHistory Of Cowboy HatsCowboy Hat EtiquetteThe X Factor Hat Rating  ShopHTML SitemapReturn PolicyTerms & ConditionsPrivacy Policy Copyright 2023 © Bernard Hats.

      "Season of the chullo - International Herald Tribune target=\"_blank\"> width=\"768\" height=\"90\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" />Opinioniht.comBusinessCultureSportsOpinionAMERICASEUROPEASIA/PACIFICAFRICA/MIDDLE EAST TECH/MEDIASTYLEHEALTHTRAVELPROPERTIESBLOGSDISCUSSIONSSPECIAL REPORTSAUDIONEWSMorning home delivery - save up to 72%SEARCHAdvancedSearchMEANWHILE\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeason of the chulloBy Verlyn Klinkenborg Published: January 23, 2009  E-Mail Article   Listen to Article  Printer-Friendly  3-Column Format  Translate  Share Article    Text SizeMEANWHILEIn the past few months, a surprising number of people have said to me, \"Oh, by the way, I'm going to Peru,\" as if no further explanation were needed.One thing I do know. While they're there, they will probably buy a chullo or two, one of those cone-like alpaca pan-Andean hats with earflaps. Judging from the look of New York, a lot of people have been to Peru recently. Gone is the Afghan pakol. Gone is the keffiyeh. This is the winter of the Andean hat.If there's a political statement in the chullo, it's a little hard to decipher. Perhaps it signals indigenousness, international-ness.But what it mostly says is, I don't care how I look as long as I'm warm. I've seen chullos that look like one cup of a knit bikini top and some that make their wearers look like mittenheads, complete with dangling strings. The other day I saw a fur-lined chullo that looked as though it had eaten the elder George Bush's Russian hat.Today in OpinionA good start in reviving the economySuing the BelugasAlberto Gonzales: The sequelYou can give a fedora a rakish tilt. You can wear a hoodie with sinister élan. But it's impossible to wear a chullo stylishly. It is to the noggin what a golf club cover is to a 3-wood. It is a bag for the head.In a way, seeing so many chullos in New York is a little like seeing so many baseball caps on Peruvians and Bolivians - a token of our global inclusiveness, like the Andean musicians you hear in the subways playing what you think is Paul Simon but is really a Peruvian classic.Perhaps the anti-stylishness of the chullo - its simple functionality - is its politics. The fact is that really cold weather eclipses style. I see men and women wearing earmuffs that look like noseplugs. They are clearly trying to keep their hair kempt. It's a lost cause. Your hair is not truly your own until warmer days and higher humidity return. Until then, there is no better way to get hat hair than a chullo.When the thermometer bottoms out, I remember, again, that winter isn't a season, it's a place. Just over the hill is the 19th century, and somewhere beyond the river lies the 18th. Why winter should seem so much more continuous with the past than summer does is never clear to me. But this morning it's 3 degrees, and I can hear Melville, a few miles north of where I am, writing to his sister: \"The weather here has been as cold as ever. Other than the weather I know not what to write about from Pittsfield.\"That's how it feels in the neighborhood of zero. There is no \"other than the weather.\" I feed the woodstove, keep the diesel pickup plugged in, and admire the fortitude of the crows. On the reservoirs, a couple of Canada geese walk along the edge of the ice as though they were lifeguards. The rivers - all but the Hudson - dwindle to a narrow sluice of dark water. It takes an effort to remember that the water, which looks so bitterly cold, is the warmest element in the landscape.As dusk comes, the temporal illusion seems to gain strength. The snowmobile tracks that cross the fields fade, and I imagine a huddled figure coming through the trees and stumping down the hill as if he had walked right out of the distant past and was making his way toward the lights of this house. The smoke from the chimney smells completely familiar to him, whatever century he comes from. And about then in my private storytelling, I remember that I'm living in the warmer, brighter future that everyone in the country of winter has always aspired to.A couple of nights ago, dusk brought a different illusion. The clouds had been hammered flat. But in the last few moments of afternoon, the sun slid below the overcast, coming out strong and red along the rim of the horizon. It brought no real warmth. But I could not help feeling that this was the sun of summer shining all the way back into winter's heart; just a glimpse to see how we were all doing here huddled together. That was enough to turn my thoughts to soil and seeds and new shoots rising.Verlyn Klinkenborg is a member of the New York Times editorial board.Back to topHome  >  OpinionIHT.com Home »Latest NewsJohan Spanner for The New York TimesIn violent Mosul, a test of Iraq's democracyIn much of Iraq, the elections Saturday will take place in something like normalcy.

      "\tMalema under fire over slur on IndiansMalema under fire over slur on Indians2011-10-20 10:27Johannesburg - There was outrage over ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema calling Indians \"coolies\" at a gathering in Thembelihle, south of Johannesburg, according to a report on Thursday.\"Bana ba lena ba tshwanetše ba dumelelwe gore ba tsene sekolo le bana ba makula mona [your children must be allowed to go to school with coolie children],\" he was quoted as saying by Business Day newspaper.Over 600 residents had gathered to hear Malema speak ahead of planned marches for \"economic freedom\" in Johannesburg and Pretoria.Minority Front leader, Amichand Rajbansi was outraged by Malema's pronouncements, according to the report.\"Mr Malema is doing great harm to social cohesion and interracial harmony,\" Rajbansi was quoted saying.He urged the African National Congress to take steps against Malema.ANC spokesperson Keith Khoza told Business Day the ruling party was not aware of the matter.\"But certainly we expect ANC leadership to be responsible in any pronouncement... they need not offend other communities,\" Khoza told the newspaper.CommentsMike - 2011-10-20 10:31\t                            If JM can get away with this Darren Scott should get his job back at Multi Choice                            Rory - 2011-10-20 10:35\t                                    Goodness NO flippen ways!!!

It was a political speech about equal rights. It was said by someone who want non-paying schoolchildren to attend high class schools probably for free.                                    msendi - 2011-10-20 10:33\t                            What is wrong with this guy???                            vdwjasper - 2011-10-20 11:30\t                                    I'm in no way a Malema fan, but in what way is \"cooley\" derogatory? What does it even mean? I can literally see the porras licking their lips for the first public figure to call them that.

This was the name the English had given to the indians. \"Coolies\" were not allowed to walk on pavements or travel in 1st class on the the train or own land, hence the name Coolie has quite a bitter taste to it. Such a pity we have names for each other and just cant seem to move on.                                    Jack - 2011-10-20 15:00\t                                    Actually, the word Coolie comes from Urdu and means \"day-labourer\". It was used by the Pommies to describe any unskilled labour from the Asian region (including China, Japan and India amongst others). It became the SA word for a person of Indian descent through usage - all the Indians at that time being \"coolies\". The various Nguni names for persons of Indian descent were derived from the word Coolie, which is now considered to be politically incorrect. The Nguni variations are thus, by association, politically incorrect.                                    nasheenar - 2011-10-20 15:22\t                                    VDWJasper - Wiki's take on the word Coolie.Coolie (variously spelled Cooli, Cooly, Kuli, Quli, Koelie etc.) is a historical term for manual labourers or slaves from Asia, particularly China, India, and the Phillipines during the 19th century and early 20th century. It is also a contemporary racial slur or ethnic nickname for people of Asian descent, including people from India, Central Asia, etc[1], particularly in South Africa[2                                    debbie.van.niekerk - 2012-05-09 13:08\t                                    I know the answer...

Firstly, I am Indian, raised in a so-called 'Indian' area, and in my entire high school years (mid-90s) I studied alongside black students. I now have children who are in pre-school and they are also learning alongside black and white students. So what am I missing out here?

The Indians and whites don't have a problem if they don't go to schools with black children so why do they have a problem if their people don't go to schools with children from other races? Does he really see blacks as that inferior and does he feel if blacks go to \"only black\" schools they're being discriminated against. Perhaps he knows something we don't about blacks. Interesting!!                                    Mandla - 2011-10-20 10:58\t                            it is unfortunate that most of us when we refer to Indians in our native language we usually call them Makula, however it is unfortunate and regretable that the ghost of colonialism is still haunting us. Cde Julius was not speaking in the spirit of racial segregation. i would say his utterances were informed by racial hatred if he had spoken in English. just that certain people like to be alarmists and they get this to be an opportunity to persue their pythonic agenda                            mastersvoice - 2011-10-20 11:12\t                                    Mandla - its a sad day when followers have to try and make up excuses for their leaders.

Harry - 2011-10-20 14:55\t                                    Okay, Lets say that he made another mistake. So, what is the comment about \"going to school with Indians\". What is he trying to say? Black kids have been going to schools in previously Indian areas since the early 90's. Does he have evidence that certain schools are prevent Black students from attending. If so, then he should take the department of education to Court. @Mandla, I suspect he is just trying to get people to go to his march and support him but causing tension in that area between Black Africans and Indian people. I guess you can lead by creating unity or by sowing division...                                    Red - 2011-11-16 00:29\t                                    So what you are saying is that only white people need to reform their language as times change, but black people don't need to? Wow, that's incredibly racist. As times have changed and people have learned from their mistakes we have changed the words we use accordingly. There are certain words we no longer use to describe gay people, black people, people with disabilities and people of Indian decent. Are you telling me that black people are not capable of changing their vocabulary too? That was a very weak excuse Mandla. None of us are perfect.. white, black, gay or straight. Black people will never be able to lift themselves up as a people group until they get over blaming colonialism for absolutely everything. Weak cowardly people do that. I think you and SA black people are better and stronger than that and I have hope and faith that they (and you) can take responsibility for their own actions. It starts by making our leaders responsible for the things they do and say. Be a grown up. Be responsible for yourself. And hold the feet of our leaders to the flame.                                    jade.neil - 2011-10-20 11:00\t                            Uhmmmmmm was he not supposed to be in hospital for \"flu-like\" symptoms????????.  he MOST certainly DOES NOT look sick.
